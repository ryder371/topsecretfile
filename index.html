        <p>
            i’ve been thinking for a long time about how i should talk to you. i don’t know if this is the right time, 
            but i felt the need to talk about it, because more than anything, i truly want to make things right between us.
        </p>
        <p>
            first of all, i want to apologize for what i did. i admit that i was wrong for not being aware of my actions. 
            i was clueless and stupid for not realizing the situation until you had to tell me. i know how frustrating that must’ve been, 
            and i’m really, truly sorry.
        </p>
        <p>
            i honestly didn’t know that it was too much already. i thought it was just a friendly interaction. 
            i didn’t realize it was becoming more than that, and i regret not seeing it sooner. the truth is, i didn’t make 
            a big deal out of it because, to me, it meant nothing—I just assumed she was trying to make her boyfriend jealous 
            or something like that. i didn’t set any boundaries, i didn’t question anything—I just let it all happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            i’m not going to lie just to make it look like i didn’t do anything wrong—because i did. i honestly don’t even remember 
            how it all started with her. i just remember her being friendly and checking in on me, which i appreciated, especially since 
            we didn’t know each other personally. that’s why i was surprised when she kept asking if i was okay and kept initiating 
            conversations. as for the other interactions, i wasn’t aware that they had already started crossing a line. i didn’t know that 
            it could be seen as more than just being friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            i hope i’ve explained things clearly. if anything i said still sounds confusing or if you still have doubts, 
            i completely understand. i’m willing to talk and explain things better in a way that makes more sense to you. 
            i have a lot of regrets about what happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            i’m not expecting things to go back to how they used to be right away. i’m not asking you to forget what happened. 
            i’m not asking you to act like nothing changed. i just hope you can see that i’m owning up to my mistakes now. i’m sorry, 
            and i hope we can still talk. i’m truly sorry for everything that i did and everything that happened.
        </p>
